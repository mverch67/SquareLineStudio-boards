**Overview**<br>
This repository contains supplemental projects for SquareLine Studio following the Open Board Platform (OBP).

**Installation**<br>
Copy the contents of the boards folder into the boards folder of SquareLine Studio, e.g.
$HOME/SquareLine/boards/

**Usage**<br>
1. Launch SquareLine Studio, choose **Create** and select **PlatformIO**
2. Now you see all available PlatformIO based projects (as in the screenshot above, currently only for *lovyanGFX*).
3. Choose *VSCode with lovyanGFX* when you have devices with TFT screen, such as WT32-SC01 Plus, T-Deck, T-Watch S3, Heltec-Tracker.
4. Enter a name for the new project
5. Create a new directory for this project and select it.
6. Enter the display dimensions of the device. Note: only landscape is currently pre-configured. Leave *rotation* and *offset* as they are.
7. Select LVGL version and theme (light/dark)
8. Finally press **CREATE**

**UI Design**<br>
See https://docs.squareline.io/docs/squareline


**Code Generation**<br>
When you finished the UI design and want to see how it looks on your device you have to export the UI files. Before you do that you should choose **Export > Create Template Project**. Here you navigate to a directory where you want the VScode project folder to be created.
Whenever you make changes to the UI you can then generate the code into the same folder by selecting **Export > Export UI Files**.

**Compilation**<br>
After the export finished open the export folder in VScode and wait a few seconds until platformIO has configured the project. Then **Switch Project Environment** from the list in the status bar according to your device and hit the build button next to it.

**Upload to Device**<br>
Connect the device to your computer and hit the **upload** button. To see the debug log messages hit the **Serial Monitor** button in the status bar.
